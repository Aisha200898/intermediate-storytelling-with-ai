# ðŸ§ª Activity 1: Let's start to read the data

1. Open `app.py` and use GitHub Copilot to generate initial code by entering (try with Ctrl-I to open chat pallete vs. chat): 

    ```
    i have weather data in a csv, can you load it for me and help me analyze
    ```

2. Review the generated code, then run it using one of these options:

- **Option 1:** Use the Play (Run/Debug) button at the top right of the `app.py` file in VS Code to start the program.
- **Option 2:** Run it in the terminal:
  ```
  cd lesson-2.3
  python app.py
  ```

3. Notice the first two rows are header data, skip the first row by updating the read as needed, note the column names. 
    ```
    skip the first row
    ```
# ðŸ§ª Activity 2: Review/Clean the Raw Data

Before using the CSV, students can practice:
1. Inspecting the raw file, Notice the Date is not of type date, it looks like a generic number

    ```
    Date column should be converted to datetime with the format mm/dd/yyyy
    ```

2. Any missing or malformed data
    ```
    check for missing values
    ```

3. Renaming columns for clarity
    ```
    rename the tMax column to Temperature Max
    do the same for tMin, tAvg, tMax, pressureAvg, pressureMin, precipitationTotal
    ```

4. Drop data that is not needed for analysis
    ```
    delete dewMax, dewMin, dewAvg columns
    ```

5. Saving the cleaned version as a CSV
    ```
    Save the cleaned DataFrame to a new CSV file
    ```

# ðŸ§ª Activity 3: Visualize the updated data
1. Display raw data
    ```
    display raw data using streamlit library, allowing users to scroll through the data with page by page controls
    ```

 - correct page controls if needed, e.g.

    ```
    remove page controls from sidebar, and place with the data table
    ```

2. What are temperature highs and lows by month
    ```
    how would i show the hottest and coldest days by month
    ```

3. Draw a line chart comparing the 3 temperatures
    ```
    generate a line chart with a line for Min Temperature, Max Temperature, and Avg Temperature
    ```

4. What days are walkable?

    ```
    based on this data, what do you think would be the best days to go for a walk, list the days in the app
    ```

5. Walkable by month?

    ```
    over the course of this year, what percentage of days were walkable by month, display in pie chart for each month
    ```

-   correct if needed, e.g.:
    ```
    show each month on a separate tab with the month name
    ```

6. Any other graphs? 

    ```
    what graphs do you suggest for this data to show trends or make predications
    ```

7. Select and implement one of the methods suggested, will the graph make sense to your users?discuss usefulness (e.g. correlation one)

# ðŸ§ª Activity 4: Reflect
- Are there other data sets or domains you'd be interested in to analyze? 
- Could you use this in your hackathon project to look at metrics?

# ðŸ§ª Activity 5: Review learn module homework (uses jupyter notebooks)
