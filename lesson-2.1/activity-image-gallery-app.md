## Prerequisites

Before beginning this activity, ensure you have:

1. **AI-generated images**: Use images you've created with Bing Image Creator or other AI tools
2. **Web browser**: Modern browser with JavaScript enabled
3. **Basic understanding of image files**: Familiarity with common image formats (JPG, PNG, etc.)

## Activity Steps

1. **Launch the Image Gallery Application**: Begin by launching the application using VS Code:

   ```bash
   # Open VS Code's Run and Debug panel (Ctrl+Shift+D)
   # Select "Streamlit: Image Gallery App" from the dropdown
   # Click the green play button or press F5
   ```

   The application will open in your default web browser at http://localhost:8501

2. **Upload Your AI-Generated Images**: Add your images to the gallery:

   - In the "Upload New Images" section, click "Browse files"
   - Select one or more images you've created with AI tools
   - Wait for the upload confirmation
   - Note how each image appears in the gallery after uploading

3. **Explore Different View Modes**: Try different ways to view your gallery:

   - Select "Grid View" to see all images in a tiled layout
   - Choose "Slideshow" to view images one at a time with navigation controls
   - Use "Detail View" to examine individual images with metadata
   - Compare which view works best for different types of images

4. **Manage Your Image Collection**: Organize your gallery:

   - Remove any unwanted images using the Image Management section
   - Use the demo images feature to see how the gallery works with sample content
   - Download images to your local device when needed

5. **Create a Themed Collection**: Build a gallery with a specific theme:

   - Use AI tools to generate a set of related images (e.g., landscapes, characters, etc.)
   - Upload these themed images to create a cohesive collection
   - Arrange and view them using the different gallery modes

6. **Share Your Gallery**: Prepare your gallery for presentation:

   - Choose the best view mode for your collection
   - Take screenshots or prepare to demonstrate your gallery live
   - Be ready to explain the prompt engineering process behind your images

## Extended Learning

1. **Image Series Creation**: Use AI tools to create a sequence of related images that tell a story when viewed in order.

2. **Style Consistency**: Experiment with prompts that maintain a consistent art style across multiple images.

3. **Comparative Gallery**: Create galleries that compare different AI image generation tools or techniques.

4. **Custom Gallery Enhancement**: Think about how the gallery app could be improved - what features would you add?
