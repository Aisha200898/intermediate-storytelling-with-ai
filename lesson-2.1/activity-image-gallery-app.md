# Activity - AI Image Gallery: Create, manage, and showcase your AI-generated images

## Summary

In this activity, you'll learn how to use a Streamlit web application to create and manage a gallery of your AI-generated images. This hands-on exercise demonstrates how to organize, display, and share visual content previously created with AI tools like Bing Image Creator or Microsoft Designer. By the end, you'll understand how to build a portfolio of your AI-generated artwork and present it in different viewing formats.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning this activity, ensure you have:

1. **AI-generated images**: Use images you've created with Bing Image Creator or other AI tools
2. **Web browser**: Modern browser with JavaScript enabled
3. **Basic understanding of image files**: Familiarity with common image formats (JPG, PNG, etc.)

## Activity Steps
 
1. **Upload Your AI-Generated Images**: Add your images to the my)images folder:
 
   - Navigate to the my_images folder, 2nd mouse click and select Upload
   - Select one or more images you've created with AI tools
   - Wait for the upload confirmation
   - Note how each image appears in the folder after uploading
   
2. Use agent mode to create code that shows all images in a slideshow with navigation controls
 
    ```text
   create a streamlit application in the `my_gallery.py` file that looks at the my_images folder
   and displays all included images in a slideshow format and user can navigate between images.
    ```
 
   - Save your changes and refresh the gallery app to see the slideshow in action  
3. **Launch the Image Gallery Application**: Begin by launching the application using the terminal:
 
   ```bash
   # cd lesson-2.1
   # streamlit run my_gallery.py
   ```
 
   The application will open in streamlit in your web browser, displaying your uploaded images in a gallery
 
4. **Explore Different View Modes**: Try different ways to view your gallery:
 
   - Ask copilot to update to show a "Grid View" to see all images in a tiled layout
   - Compare which view works best for different types of images
 
5. **Manage Your Image Collection**: Organize your gallery:
 
   - Remove any unwanted images, add additional images, or rearrange the order of images
   - Download images to your local device when needed
  
6. **Create a Themed Collection**: Build a gallery with a specific theme (or visual storyboard):

   - Use AI tools to generate a set of related images (e.g., landscapes, characters, etc.)
   - Upload these themed images to create a cohesive collection
   - Arrange and view them using the different gallery modes

7. **Share Your Gallery**: Prepare your gallery for presentation:

   - Choose the best view mode for your collection
   - Take screenshots or prepare to demonstrate your gallery live
   - Be ready to explain the prompt engineering process behind your images

## Extended Learning

1. **Image Series Creation**: Use AI tools to create a sequence of related images that tell a story when viewed in order.

2. **Style Consistency**: Experiment with prompts that maintain a consistent art style across multiple images.

3. **Comparative Gallery**: Create galleries that compare different AI image generation tools or techniques.

4. **Custom Gallery Enhancement**: Think about how the gallery app could be improved - what features would you add?

## Reflection Questions

1. How do different view modes change the way viewers experience your AI-generated images?
2. What patterns did you notice in the types of images that work best in different gallery formats?
3. How could an image gallery like this be used professionally or creatively?
4. What challenges did you encounter when organizing or displaying your AI-generated content?
5. How does seeing AI-generated images in a gallery context change your perception of them as creative works?
