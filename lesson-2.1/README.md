# Lesson 2.1: AI Image and Text Generation

## üéØ Learning Objectives

- Evaluate and compare various AI image generation models to understand their respective strengths and appropriate use cases.
- Master advanced prompting techniques for creating compelling visual narratives with consistent style across multiple images.

## üìå Lesson Overview [10 minutes]

## ‚úîÔ∏è Activities [40 minutes]

- [**Create a Digital Self Portrait**](activity-create-a-digita-self-portrait.md): Use Bing Image Creator to generate a self-portrait that reflects your personality and style. Share your portrait with the class and discuss how the details in your prompt influenced the final image.


- [**Create an Executive Summary**](activity-create-an-executive-summary.md): Write a brief executive summary of your about your Hackathon project, using AI-generated images to enhance the narrative. Share your summary with the class and discuss.

- [**Create a Logo**]: Use Bing Image Creator or Microsoft Designer to design a logo for your Hackathon project using AI image generation tools, ensuring it aligns with your project's theme and goals.

- [**Optional - Create a visual gallery of your images**](activity-image-gallery-app.md): Use copilot and streamlit to create a web app that displays a gallery of your images generated by AI.

## Prompt Guidance
AI-powered image generation tools produce images based on text descriptions. The quality of the images generated depends on the quality of the prompt. The prompt should be specific and include details. Examples of such details are the object or character, the setting or background, the medium, style, or any other adjectives that convey the desired aesthetic.

For instance, if your prompt input is only "tree," the output generated could be a tall oak in a forest, a tiny bonsai on a windowsill, or even a fantastical tree creature. So, instead of a single-word prompt, use a prompt that paints a clearer picture.

Here are a few specifics to include in your prompt:

- **Subject:** Instead of just using "tree" for your prompt, make it descriptive. For example, you can prompt with "majestic oak tree with spreading branches."
- **Setting or background**: In your prompt, describe where the tree is, like ‚Äúa lush green forest" or ‚Äúa sunny park by a lake."
- **Artistic style**: Specify a medium for the art or how you want the image to look, such as "watercolor painting," "retro photograph," or "modern digital art."
- **Adjectives for the mood**: Add words that describe the feeling or ambiance, like "serene," "energetic," "dreamy," "vibrant," or "calming."
- **Directive details**: Instead of prompting with "ocean sunset," describe the image you want to create. Use a more descriptive prompt like "realistic illustration of an ocean sunset with vibrant hues and silhouettes of palm trees in the foreground."

## üìëKey Terms

- **AI Image Generation**: The process of using AI models to create images based on text prompts or other inputs.

- **Diffusion**: A process in generative models where noise is gradually transformed into a coherent image, often used in AI image generation.

- **GANs**: (Generative Adversarial Networks): Generator vs. discriminator architecture where 2 models interact to train and generate images‚Äã

- **Prompt Engineering**: The art of crafting effective prompts to guide AI models in generating desired outputs.
- **Visual Narrative**: A storytelling technique that uses images to convey a story or message.
