The portrait should look polished and realistic while maintaining artistic quality, with fine details in the face and clothing textures.
   ```

- **Create an Executive Summary**: Write a brief executive summary of your about your Hackathon project, using AI-generated images to enhance the narrative.

### **Create an Executive Summary**

Use AI tools like Azure OpenAI Service or Bing Chat to create a compelling executive summary for your Hackathon project. This summary will communicate your project's core value and be enhanced with AI-generated images.

1. **Start with Basic Project Information**: Begin with a simple prompt that captures your project's essence:

   ```text
   Write an executive summary for a student hackathon project called [project name] that focuses on [main purpose]
   ```

2. **Add Project Details**: Enhance your prompt with specific information about your solution:

   ```text
   Write a concise executive summary for a hackathon project called [project name] that solves [problem] by using [technology/approach]. The target audience is [specific users].
   ```

3. **Add Business Value and Implementation**: Include details about impact and how it works:

   ```text
   Create a professional executive summary for a hackathon project called [project name] that addresses [specific problem] for [target audience]. Our solution uses [technologies] to provide [key benefits]. The implementation involves [brief technical approach] and could potentially impact [scope of impact].
   ```

4. **Add Metrics and Future Vision**: Include performance indicators and growth potential:

   ```text
   Write a compelling executive summary for [project name], a solution that tackles [detailed problem statement] for [specific demographic]. Our approach leverages [specific technologies/methodologies] to deliver [measurable outcomes]. Initial testing shows [key metrics/results]. Future development will focus on [growth areas] with potential applications in [related fields/industries].
   ```

5. **Create Complete Executive Summary**: Use a comprehensive prompt that includes all necessary elements:

   ```text
   Create a polished, investor-ready executive summary for [project name], an innovative solution developed at [hackathon name]. The summary should include: 1) A compelling problem statement about [specific problem] affecting [target audience], 2) Our unique approach using [technologies/methodologies], 3) Key differentiators from existing solutions, 4) Preliminary results showing [metrics], 5) Implementation roadmap with timeline, 6) Potential market impact and scalability, and 7) A brief conclusion highlighting our team's expertise in [relevant skills]. Use professional business language that would appeal to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
   ```
