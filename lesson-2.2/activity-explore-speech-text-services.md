   Try these tongue twisters for fun:

   ```Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.
   A peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked.
   If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers,
   Where’s the peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked?
   ```
   ```Betty Botter bought some butter
   But she said the butter’s bitter
   If I put it in my batter, it will make my batter bitter
   But a bit of better butter will make my batter better
   So ‘twas better Betty Botter bought a bit of better butter
   ```

   5. **Test Speech Translation**: Use the speech translation feature:

   - Click on the `Speech translation` option
